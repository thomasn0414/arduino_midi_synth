# Arduino MIDI Synth with LCD Display

This project allows you to create a MIDI-controlled synthesizer using an Arduino, an ultrasonic sensor, and an LCD display. The sensor detects distance, and based on that, MIDI notes are generated and sent to a DAW (like Reaper) via Hairless MIDI and loopMIDI. You can recreate this setup using the following guide, along with the Tinkercad model and Arduino code.

The system sends MIDI chords based on the distance detected by the sensor and displays the distance on an LCD screen. It's perfect for creating ambient or meditation-style music.

## Features
- Ultrasonic sensor controlling MIDI notes.
- LCD display showing the distance in real-time.
- Smooth MIDI note transitions.
- Use with Reaper, Hairless MIDI, and loopMIDI.
